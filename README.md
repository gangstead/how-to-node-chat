# The Slides
### TL;DR [Slides here](https://gangstead.github.io/how-to-node-chat)

Since the default branch is gh-pages, go to http://gangstead.github.io/how-to-node-chat to view the slides.

To view the slides locally start a [static http server](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) from that directory.  My preferred way:

```
# one time, to install the dependency
> npm install -g http-server

# start the server in the base directory. -o flag opens browser
> http-server -o
```
